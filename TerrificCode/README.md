# Terrific Code

## How to run:

To compile and run in Terminal:
1. make all
2. ./Main

## Improvements to Terrible Code:
This program improves on the provided terrible code by:

1. Creating new classes for separate systems (e.g., Health)
2. Creating a derived child class for Player based on Human Actor
3. Creating enums and support files for organization. 
4. Setting access specifiers as appropriate.
5. Selecting more appropriate data types throughout.
6. Creating data structures to group meaningfully connected variables

## Further Improvements:

#### Stats class
There should be a Stats system for handling player stats such as Health, Stamina, Experience.
The player would then possess a stats array based on enum.
The Health class would then be a derived child of the Stats class.
This was a bit out of scope so time was not spent on it.
